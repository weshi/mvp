# Data Validation

# Add data validation to Excel ranges

The Excel JavaScript Library provides APIs to enable your add-in to add automatic data validation to tables, columns, rows, and other ranges in a workbook. To understand the concepts and the terminology of data validation, please see the following articles about how users add data validation through the Excel UI:

## Programmatic control of data validation

The `Range.dataValidation` property, which takes a  [DataValidation](https://dev.office.com/reference/add-ins/excel/datavalidation) object, is the entry point for programmatic control of data validaiton in Excel. There are five properties to the `DataValidation` object:

- `rule` &#8212; Defines what constitutes valid data for the range. See [DataValidationRule](https://dev.office.com/reference/add-ins/excel/datavalidationrule).
- `errorAlert` &#8212; Specifies whether an error pops up if the user enters invalid data, and defines the alert text, title, and style; for example, **Informational**, **Warning**, and **Stop**. See [DataValidationErrorAlert](https://dev.office.com/reference/add-ins/excel/datavalidationerroralert).
- `prompt` &#8212; Specifies whether a prompt appears when the user hovers over the range and defines the prompt message. See [DataValidationPrompt](https://dev.office.com/reference/add-ins/excel/datavalidationprompt).
- `ignoreBlanks` &#8212; Specifies whether the data validation rule applies to blank cells in the range. Defaults to `true`.
- `type` &#8212; A read-only identification of the validation type, such as WholeNumber, Date, TextLength, etc. It is set indirectly when you set the `rule` property.

> [!NOTE]
> Data validation added programmatically behaves just like manually added data validation. In particular, note that data validation is triggered only if the user directly types a value into a cell or copies and pastes a cell from elsewhere in the workbook and takes the **Values** paste option. If the user copies a cell and does a plain paste into a range with data validation, validation is not triggered.

### Creating validation rules

To add data validation to a range, your code must set the `rule` proeprty of the `DataValidation` object in `Range.dataValidation`. This takes a [DataValidationRule](https://dev.office.com/reference/add-ins/excel/datavalidationrule) object which has seven optional properties. *No more than one of these properties may be present in any `DataValidationRule` object.* The property that you include determines the type of validation.
